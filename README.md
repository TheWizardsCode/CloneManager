# CloneManager
Unity Asset to make working with multiplayer Unity projects easier.

CloneManager clones your project so you don't have to build clients.
You have two unity instances one server one client (or many clients).
The code is all symlinked so you just hit play on each instead of building
indivudal clients, it makes for a much easier workflow.
